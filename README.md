## 💡 About Me

I am an entry-level biologist with a B.S. in Biology and a Minor in Molecular Biology. My diverse experience as a Claims Adjuster and an Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) specialist has built a strong skill set in:
* **Adaptability & Communication:** I've honed my ability to adapt quickly and communicate productively with diverse groups, from medical specialists and state adjudicators to cross-functional teams and management.
* **Compliance & Auditing:** My roles required continually auditing claims and policies to verify compliance with state and federal regulations (WA L&I, OSHA, WISHA).
* **Data & Analysis:** I strive for efficiency and excellence in my tasks and have extensive experience analyzing and applying data using tools like Excel and RStudio.

I am eager to apply my organized, detail-oriented approach to complex regulatory frameworks like NIST SP 800-171 or CMMC to support federal compliance initiatives in an Information Security Analyst capacity.
